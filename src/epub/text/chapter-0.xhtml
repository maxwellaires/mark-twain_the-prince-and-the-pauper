<blockquote>
<p>
<b> 	I will set down a tale as it was told to me by one who had it of his
 father, which latter had it of HIS father, this last having in like
 manner had it of HIS father⁠—and so on, back and still back, three
 hundred years and more, the fathers transmitting it to the sons and so
 preserving it. It may be history, it may be only a legend, a
 tradition. It may have happened, it may not have happened: but it
 COULD have happened. It may be that the wise and the learned
 believed it in the old days; it may be that only the unlearned and the
 simple loved it and credited it.
